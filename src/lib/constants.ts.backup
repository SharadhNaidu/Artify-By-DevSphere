POSE MAINTENANCE: Keep the exact same body positions, head angles, hand gestures, and spatial relationships between people. RENAISSANCE TECHNIQUE APPLICATION: Apply ONLY the visual techniques of Renaissance oil painting - use chiaroscuro lighting (dramatic light/dark contrasts), sfumato technique (subtle gradations), rich oil paint colors with deep saturation, warm golden undertones in lighting, precise anatomical rendering, masterful glazing effects for depth, traditional Renaissance color palette (earth tones, deep reds, golden yellows, rich browns), smooth paint application with invisible brushstrokes, and sophisticated atmospheric perspective.

    prompt: "CRITICAL GENDER LOCK: First and most important - identify each person's biological gender. Males MUST remain males. Females MUST remain females. No gender changes, no ambiguous presentations, no exceptions. DETAILED IDENTITY DOCUMENTATION: For each person, record exactly: biological gender (male/female), apparent age, facial bone structure (jaw width, cheekbone prominence, chin shape), eye characteristics (shape, size, color, expression, eyelid structure), nose configuration (bridge height, width, tip shape), lip anatomy (fullness, shape, natural expression), eyebrow form (thickness, arch, positioning), facial hair presence or complete absence, hair specifications (exact color, texture, style, length, parting, natural fall), skin tone and texture, ear shape and positioning, neck proportions, clothing details (style, colors, patterns, fit, condition, accessories), body posture and positioning, hand placement and gestures, facial expression and emotional state, personality impression, and environmental interaction. ABSOLUTE IDENTITY PRESERVATION: Each person retains their complete original identity including: exact biological gender with appropriate realistic anime masculine or feminine features, same apparent age with anime enhancement, identical facial structure and proportions with realistic anime refinement, same eye characteristics enhanced with anime detail and expression, same nose form with subtle anime perfection, same lip shape with anime smoothness, same hair color and style with anime texture enhancement, same clothing items and colors with anime fabric rendering, same pose and body language with anime grace, same facial expression with anime emotional depth, and same core personality impression with anime character appeal. REALISTIC ANIME STYLE APPLICATION: Apply realistic anime aesthetic using: photorealistic proportions maintained throughout transformation, enhanced perfect skin texture with subtle natural shading, detailed expressive eyes maintaining original shape and color with anime brilliance, subtle cel-shading effects that enhance rather than flatten features, vibrant but natural color palette preserving original relationships, refined facial features that preserve original bone structure, high-quality anime rendering with attention to realistic detail, professional anime art standards with photographic accuracy, and sophisticated anime techniques that create believable character representation. TECHNICAL EXECUTION STANDARDS: Use realistic anime proportions (not exaggerated), apply perfect skin rendering with natural texture, enhance eyes with anime detail while preserving shape, create subtle shading that follows natural light, maintain realistic hair physics with anime shine, render clothing with proper fabric behavior, preserve natural body proportions and posture, and ensure professional realistic anime art quality throughout. CLOTHING AND ENVIRONMENT PRESERVATION: Maintain exact clothing items from original photo, preserve all colors and patterns accurately, keep same style and fit characteristics, maintain same accessories if present, preserve background elements with realistic anime rendering, and keep same spatial relationships and environmental context. EXPRESSION AND GESTURE MAINTENANCE: Preserve exact facial expression from original, maintain same eye gaze direction and focus, keep same head position and angle, preserve body posture and stance, maintain hand positions and gestures, keep same emotional state and mood, and preserve interaction with environment and other people. FINAL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: Person immediately recognizable as themselves in realistic anime form, gender completely unchanged from original (male stays male, female stays female), age appearance preserved with anime enhancement, facial features enhanced but clearly the same person, hair color and style maintained with anime quality, clothing identical to original with anime rendering, pose and expression unchanged from original, and overall result looks like a high-quality realistic anime version of the specific person shown. ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: Never change biological gender under any circumstances. Never alter age significantly. Never change facial bone structure beyond realistic anime enhancement. Never add accessories, clothing, or elements not in original. Never modify hair color or style dramatically. Never change poses, expressions, or body language. Never add people not present in original. Never create generic anime characters - must be recognizable as the specific individual shown.",
