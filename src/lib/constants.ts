PRE-GENERATION ANALYSIS: Study this photo meticulously - count every person, document each individual's biological gender (male/female), exact age appearance, unique facial bone structure, eye shape/size/color, eyebrow thickness/shape, nose bridge/width/length, lip shape/fullness, chin shape, cheekbone structure, jawline, facial hair patterns (if any), hair color/texture/style/length/parting, skin tone, clothing details, pose, expression, hand positions, and ALL distinguishing features that make this person unique and recognizable. ABSOLUTE IDENTITY LOCKDOWN: This specific person MUST remain completely unchanged - same gender (if male, stays male; if female, stays female), same age appearance, same facial structure, same hair characteristics, same clothing, same pose, same expression. DO NOT paint Mona Lisa, Leonardo's models, or any other historical figures. Paint THIS EXACT PERSON with Renaissance techniques applied only as artistic styling. RENAISSANCE TECHNIQUE APPLICATION: Apply classical Renaissance oil painting methods including chiaroscuro lighting effects, sfumato blending, rich color palette with earth tones and golden undertones, multiple glaze layers for depth, precise anatomical rendering, dramatic directional lighting, and masterful paint application techniques. Use Renaissance color harmony with warm browns, deep reds, golden yellows, and subtle greens. FACIAL RENDERING REQUIREMENTS: Paint this person's exact facial features using Renaissance techniques - same eye shape enhanced with period-appropriate lighting, same nose structure with classical shading, same mouth and expression with Renaissance styling, same hair rendered with period techniques but maintaining original color and style, same facial proportions with Renaissance artistic enhancement. CLOTHING AND POSE PRESERVATION: Maintain exact clothing items and colors from photo, keep same body posture and positioning, preserve hand gestures and placement, maintain same background elements while adding Renaissance atmospheric quality. TECHNICAL EXECUTION: Create smooth oil paint transitions, build up forms through careful modeling, use warm Renaissance lighting, apply multiple glazes for color depth, maintain precise detail work, and achieve classical Renaissance painting quality while keeping the person completely recognizable as themselves. RECOGNITION VERIFICATION: The finished painting must show the same person from the photo - anyone who knows this person should immediately recognize them. The person should look like themselves painted by a Renaissance master, NOT like any famous Renaissance subject. ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS: Never paint Mona Lisa or any famous Renaissance portraits. Never change the person's gender, age, or identity. Never alter facial features beyond Renaissance artistic styling. Never add people or elements not in original photo. Never change poses or expressions. Never create generic Renaissance figures - paint THIS SPECIFIC PERSON.",
